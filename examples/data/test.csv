1,1351123200,B003JK537S,A3JBPC3WFUT5ZP,1,Arrived in pieces,"Not pleased at all. When I opened the box, most of the rings were broken in pieces. A total waste of money."
2,1351123200,B000JMBE7M,AQX1N6A51QOKG,4,"It isn't blanc mange, but isn't bad . . .","I'm not sure that custard is really custard without eggs.  But this comes close.  I got it for use in a ""Vegan pancake"" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!<br />However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.<br /><br />If you want a really good egg-free ""custard"" get an original recipe for ""blanc mange.""  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference."
3,1351123200,B004AHGBX4,A2UY46X0OSNVUQ,3,These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.,"I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.  There are 7 nice big chunks in every jar.<br /><br />These taste like tuna in a can but, because they're preserved in glass, you don't have to worry about either aluminum or BPA; BUT ... they are not just tuna and spring water.<br /><br />There is salt in there, too, and it's not healthy sea salt, it's toxic table salt.<br /><br />I am trying to contact Tonnino to confirm that.  I might be wrong because the label states that the ingredients are ""tuna fish"" but the sticker on the top clarifies that it is the smaller (healthier) yellowfin, so the ""salt"" listed in the ingredients might be sea salt but, if it was, why don't they say so?<br /><br />Without confirmation, I will continue to look for a salt-free olive-oil free tuna preserved in glass.<br /><br />If you know of one, please contact me!"
4,1351123200,B001BORBHO,A1AFOYZ9HSM2CZ,5,Happy with the product,My dog was suffering with itchy skin.  He had been eating Natural Choice brand (cheaper) since he was a puppy.  I was nervous to change foods.  The vet suggested to change foods sand see if the skin issues cleared up.  Wellness brand did the job.  My dog seems to love the food and the skin issues cleared up within a few weeks.
5,1351123200,B008PSM0BQ,A3OUFIMGL2K6RS,4,Good Sauce,"This is a good all purpose sauce.  Has good flavor that the heat doesn't overpower.  Not really that spicy unless you use a whole bunch.  10 good drops is about enough to add a little heat to a pot of soup, but a lot more is needed if you want a lingering burn.  Heat isn't quite up to par with other products out there, (such as Spontaneous Combustion) but this has the true aged cayenne hot sauce flavor."
6,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A9YEAAQVHFUTX,5,Blackcat,Great coffee!  Love all Green Mountain coffee and all the wonderful flavors.  Would and do recommend this coffee to all my friends.
7,1351123200,B001KP6B98,ABWCUS3HBDZRS,5,Excellent product,After scouring every store in town for orange peels and not finding anything satisfactory I turned to the online options.<br /><br /> I received the candied orange peels today and I found exactly what I was looking for. The peels are perfect for the fruit cake I plan to bake. The peels are not crystallized with sugar which is great  I like the texture and the taste of the peels and I am gonna order another box soon.
8,1351123200,B008YA1LQK,A2RSB6FVQ9K9OD,5,Bulk k-Cups,This is the best way to buy coffee for my office. Least expensive way to buy convenience with harder to find flavor and brand.  I also buy this way for home.
9,1351123200,B001E5E2QI,A23WYVBCNE75X1,3,It's Okay,"Next time, I will buy Gevalia Irish Cream decaf coffee.  I thought this would be as good, but it's mostly sugar."
10,1351123200,B000H9K4KA,A2WMZYYF8OSGD6,5,FABULOUS...,Absolutely wonderful.  A real licorice taste.  No phony baloney here!<br />It has a great flavor.  I'd purchase it again for sure.
